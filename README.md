# ABAP Flight Reference Scenario for the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model 
The ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model defines the architecture for efficient end-to-end development of intrinsically SAP HANA-optimized Fiori apps in SAP BTP ABAP Environment and on Application Server ABAP. It supports the development of all types of Fiori applications as well as Web APIs. It is based on technologies and frameworks such as Core Data Services (CDS) for defining semantically rich data models and a service model infrastructure for creating OData services with bindings to an OData protocol and ABAP-based application services for custom logic and SAPUI5-based user interfaces.

The ABAP Flight Reference Scenario provides sample data and services as well as legacy business logic to get familiar with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model. You can check out the end-to-end scenarios or build your own app based on the sample data.
